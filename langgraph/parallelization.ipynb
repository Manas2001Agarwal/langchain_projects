       "  \"Narendra Modi Stadium is a cricket ground in Motera, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. With a total capacity of 132,000, it is the world's largest stadium. It is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association, and hosts both domestic and international cricket matches. The stadium has hosted several high-profile matches, such as the 2023 One Day International World Cup final. It is named after the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. \\nIt replaced the Sardar Patel Stadium, which hosted domestic and international cricket in the city until its demolition in 2015, including the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket World Cups. In 2014, it was decided that a new stadium should be built on the same plot. The new stadium, originally named Motera Stadium, was designed by Populous and built by Larsen and Toubro. It took five years to build, at an estimated cost of ₹800 crore (US$95 million). After completion, the new arena replaced the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The stadium has four dressing rooms, 11 centre pitches, and two practice grounds. The practice grounds can also serve as venues for domestic matches.\\nThe new stadium opened to the public in 2020 amid the Namaste Trump event. In 2021, the stadium was renamed Narendra Modi Stadium in honour of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who  had previously served as chief minister of Gujarat (2001–2014) and president of the GCA (2009-2014). In 2021, the stadium was inaugurated with Indian President Ram Nath Kovind presiding over the event.\\nOn 24 February 2021, the stadium hosted its first Test match, when home side India played against England.

       "  'In psychology, libido (; from Latin  libīdō) is a desiring energy, usually conceived of as sexual in nature, but sometimes also encompasses other forms of needs. The term was originally developed by Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psychoanalysis. Initially referred only to specific sexual needs, he expanded the concept later to an universal desire thats great reservoir is the Id. As driving energy behind all life processes, libido became the source of the social engagement (maternal love instinct, f. e.), sexual behaviour, pursuit for nutrition, skin pleasure, knowledge and victory in all areas of self- and species preservation. \\nEquated the libido with the Eros of Platonic philosophy, Freud further differentiated two inherent operators: the life drive and the death drive. Both aspects are working complementary to each other: While the death drive, also called Destrudo or Thanatos, embodies the principle of \\'analytical\\' decomposition of complex phenomenon, the effect of life drive (Greek Bios) is to reassemble or synthesise the parts of the decomposition in a way that serves the organisms regeneration and reproduction. Freud\\'s most abstract description of libido represents an energetic potential that begins like a bow to tense up unpleasantly (noticeable \\'hunger\\') in order to pleasantly relax again (noticeable satisfaction); its nature is both physical and psychological. Starting from the id in the fertilised egg, libido initiates also the emergence of two further instances: the ego (function of conscious perception), and the superego, which specialises in retrievable storage of experiences (long-term memory). Together with the libido as their surce, this three instance represent the common core of all branches of psychoanalysis.\\nFrom a neurobiological point of view, the inner perception and regulation of the various innate needs are mediated through the nucleus accumbens by neurotransmitters and hormones; in relation to sexuality, these are mainly testosterone, oestrogen and dopamine. Each of the needs can be influenced by the others (e.g. baby feeding is inextricably connected with sociality); but above all, their fulfilment requires the libidinal satisfaction of curiosity. Without this \\'research instinct\\' of mind, the control of bodily motoric would be impossible, the arrow from the bow called life  wouldn\\'t do its work (death). Just as happiness is anchored in the fulfilment of all innate needs, disturbances through social stress resulting from lifestyle, traumatisation in early childhood or during war, mental and bodily illness lead to suffering that is inwardly noticeable and conscious to the ego. Through the capacity of empathy, linguistic and facial expressions of emotion ultimately also affect the human environment./nSafe sex is sexual activity using methods or contraceptive devices (such as condoms) to reduce the risk of transmitting or acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially HIV. \"Safe sex\" is also sometimes referred to as safer sex or protected sex to indicate that some safe sex practices do not eliminate STI risks. It is also sometimes used colloquially to describe methods aimed at preventing pregnancy that may or may not also lower STI risks.\\nThe concept of \"safe sex\" emerged in the 1980s as a response to the global AIDS epidemic, and possibly more specifically to the AIDS crisis in the United States. Promoting safe sex is now one of the main aims of sex education and STI prevention, especially reducing new HIV infections. Safe sex is regarded as a harm reduction strategy aimed at reducing the risk of STI transmission.\\nAlthough some safe sex practices (like condoms) can also be used as birth control (contraception), most forms of contraception do not protect against STIs. Likewise, some safe sex practices, such as partner selection and low-risk sex behavior, might not be effective forms of contraception.']}"
