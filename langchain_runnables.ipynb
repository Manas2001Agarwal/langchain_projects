      "Here are 5 interesting facts about football:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The First Football Game**: The first intercollegiate football game was played on November 6, 1869, between Rutgers University and Princeton University. However, this game was more like soccer, with 25 players on each side and a round ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The Birth of the Forward Pass**: The forward pass was banned in football until 1894, when John Heisman, a renowned football coach, successfully lobbied for its introduction. This allowed teams to throw the ball downfield, revolutionizing the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Origins of the Name 'Quarterback'**: The term 'quarterback' originated in the mid-19th century, when players would stand 10-15 yards behind the center. This position was considered the 'quarter' of the field, and the player in this position was the 'quarterback.'\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **The First Touchdown**: The first touchdown in football history was scored in 1869 by Rutgers University's William J. Leggett. The game was played without a scoreboard, but the Rutgers team was declared the winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The Super Bowl's Original Name**: The Super Bowl was originally called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game. It wasn't until Super Bowl V that the name 'Super Bowl' was officially adopted, reportedly by Lamar Hunt, the owner of the Kansas City Chiefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "These facts highlight the evolution of the game and some of its interesting historical anecdotes.\n"

      "Here are five interesting facts about neural networks:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inspiration from the Human Brain**: Neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of interconnected nodes or \"neurons\" that process and transmit information. This similarity to the brain is the reason they are called \"neural\" networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Training with Backpropagation**: One of the key algorithms used to train neural networks is backpropagation. This involves propagating the error backwards through the network, adjusting the weights and biases of each node to minimize the error. This process is repeated multiple times, with the network adjusting its weights and biases until it converges on an optimal solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The First Neural Network was Created in the 1940s**: The first neural network was created by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943. This network was a simple binary threshold logic network that could learn and adapt to new information. Since then, neural networks have evolved significantly, with the introduction of new algorithms, architectures, and applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Neural Networks can Learn from Experience**: Neural networks have the ability to learn from experience, a process known as reinforcement learning. This involves training the network on a task, then providing feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The network uses this feedback to adjust its weights and biases, allowing it to learn and improve over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Neural Networks can be Used for Self-Driving Cars**: Neural networks are being used in the development of self-driving cars. They are used to process visual data from cameras and sensors, detect obstacles and other vehicles, and make decisions about steering, acceleration, and braking. This is an example of a complex task that requires a combination of computer vision, machine learning, and control systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "These facts demonstrate the power and versatility of neural networks, and highlight some of the exciting applications and possibilities of this technology.\n"

      "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems are designed to generate answers based on the context of a given query. To evaluate the effectiveness of these systems, several metrics can be used. Here are the 5 key metrics for evaluating RAG systems along with a brief quiz to reinforce understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evaluation Metrics for RAG Systems**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correctness**: The Correctness metric verifies that the generated answer matches the reference answer. This ensures that the system is producing accurate results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Faithfulness**: The Faithfulness metric ensures that the answer accurately reflects the retrieved context, without any distortions or fabrications. This means that the system should produce answers that are true to the information it has been given.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Context Relevancy**: Context Relevancy checks the relevance of the retrieved context and the answer to the original query. This ensures that the system retrieves relevant information in response to a user's request.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Guideline Adherence**: The Guideline Adherence metric verifies that the predicted answer follows established guidelines and norms, such as stylistic, factual, and ethical standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Embedding Semantic Similarity**: Embedding Semantic Similarity compares the generated and reference answers for semantic similarity by calculating a similarity score between their embeddings. This helps estimate the closeness of the generated response to a reference in terms of semantic content.\n",
